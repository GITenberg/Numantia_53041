<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">This is an attempt to render for the first time
into readable English verse the one great
drama of Cervantes. It was presented on the
Madrid stage about the year 1586, during the reign
of Philip II., and was received with great applause
as a work of national interest. It remained, however,
unprinted and was supposed to be lost. In
1784, it was published for the first time by Sancha
of Madrid, in a volume which contained also
Cervantes' <cite lang="es" xml:lang="es">Viaje del Parnaso</cite>, and his <cite lang="es" xml:lang="es">Trato de
Argel</cite>. The Editors, with a carelessness characteristic
of the times, do not tell us how it was recovered
or where they got it. The literary world,
however, received it gladly as a work of peculiar
original power, in every way worthy of the name of
Cervantes. Strange to say, a number of years
afterwards, it sprang to life as an acting drama
during the memorable siege of Saragossa by the
French, where it had a besieged city for its stage,
and patriots and heroes for its actors and audience.
A work that has such a history, and has shown such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
persistent vitality, must have something in it worthy
of the study of all lovers of the Drama, and no
apology seems needful for presenting it now in an
English version, which preserves the original
metres, and pays due regard to accuracy and
idiomatic expression.</p>

<p>Rightly to estimate such a production we must
take into account the period during which it was
written and the purpose for which it was invented.
Cervantes was at this time about thirty-nine years
of age. He returned from his captivity in Algiers
in 1580. He was married in 1584, and with the
gallantry peculiar to his nature he laid at the feet
of his bride the first fruits of his genius, a pastoral
romance known as <cite lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Galatea</cite>. The newly married
pair, who lived at Esquivias, a few miles from
Madrid, had the slenderest of fortunes, and as love
would not fill the cupboard, Cervantes followed his
natural inclination, went to Madrid, and took to
writing for the stage. Though the pay was scanty
it was better than could be got by writing sentimental
romances. He remained at this occupation
till he left for Seville in 1588, and wrote, as he tells
us, between twenty and thirty plays.</p>

<p>At this period, throughout Europe generally,
dramatic art, and tragic art especially, was still in
its infancy, and its laws and principles were as yet
undetermined. In Italy Tasso had produced his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
"Aminta" at Ferrara, and Guarini his "Pastor
Fido" at Milan (1585), but Italian Tragedy had
yet to await the advent of Maffei, Metastasio, and
Alfieri in long after years. In France Corneille
and Racine were as yet unborn. In England such
authors as Marlowe, Greene, and Peele were beginning
their careers, and Shakespeare, a youth of
twenty-two (he was seventeen years the junior of
Cervantes) was perchance only brooding over his
"Venus and Adonis." In Spain such writers as
Juan del Encina, Torres del Naharro, Gil de
Vicente, and the authors of the famous Tragi-Comedy,
Celestina, at the beginning and middle of
the sixteenth century, had done good service to
Spanish Literature, but had settled nothing as to
the form which the Spanish drama should take.
Cervantes himself looked upon Lope de Rueda as
the true originator of a genuine national theatre.
He died in 1565, and was buried between the
choirs of the Cathedral of Cordova (that wonderful
Moorish Mosque), an unexampled honour in
those days. A man of the people himself (he was
a gold-beater by trade) he became the idol of the
people both as actor and author. His <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pasos</i> (equivalent
to the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">proverbes</i>), founded on national
manners, and flavoured with true Spanish salt, were
unrivalled, and wherever his booth-theatre was
pitched, in town or country, he was received with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
acclamation. Cervantes, during his boyhood, was
charmed with him, and the impressions he received
were never effaced. But that homespun genius
could teach him nothing in the highest walks of
his art.</p>

<p>When Cervantes, then, began to write for the
Tragic stage he had no models before him, and
very little critical light to guide him. He was the
first genius of commanding power in modern times,
whether in Spain or elsewhere, who attempted to
compose Tragedies, and he was more or less a law
to himself. His <cite>Numantia</cite>, which German critics
declare to be the first work of real tragic power that
had appeared in Europe since the extinction of the
Greek and Roman drama, has therefore a historical
value apart altogether from its artistic merit. The
genius of Cervantes was Epic rather than Dramatic,
and it is interesting to observe that in this play,
almost his first and certainly his greatest effort, he
adopts the construction of the earlier Greek drama
in its severest form, rejecting, however, the Chorus,
which he replaces by allegorical figures serving a
similar purpose. In the main he is a follower,
consciously or unconsciously, of Aeschylus, in such
plays as the <cite>Seven against Thebes</cite>, or <cite>The Persians</cite>.
Aeschylus (according to Aristophanes) says of his
<cite>Persians</cite> that it was the "taking of a theme for
poetry of a glorious exploit (<span title="kosmêsai ergon ariston">κοσμῆσαι ἔργον ἄριστον</span>)."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
In like manner the <cite>Numantia</cite> of Cervantes is simply
a glorious page in Spanish history converted
into sounding verse.</p>

<p>Viewed then as a drama, according to modern
ideas, it is manifestly defective. It has neither plot,
passion, nor intrigue, and its subject is eminently
non-dramatic. The general use, too, of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ottava
rima</i>, with its ceaseless recurring rhymes, is more
suited to epic description than to dramatic action.
But viewed as an attempt to give form and body on
the stage to a great national event, with the intent
of inspiring patriotic feelings, its success is undoubted.
Though the first act, which presents
the motive of the play, drags somewhat, the interest
deepens with every scene, and the tremendous catastrophe,
with all its attendant accessories of mingled
horror, despair, and indomitable resolve, is
depicted with a skill, pathos, and concentrated
power hitherto unattained. In such a pictorial
representation even the despised Octave, supple,
sonorous, and monotonous, seems not out of keeping.
Each speech is uttered as it were to the beat
of the drum, or to the prolonged wailings of the
Dead March. When more vigorous description is
required Cervantes uses the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Terza rima</i> with great
effect; and in almost the only bit of action represented
(the scaling of the wall by Caius Marius) he
employs blank verse with much fitness. If Cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>vantes
had only invented for Spain a dramatic
blank verse as fine and effective as that of Shakespeare
for England, and had produced therein a
series of plays showing such original power as the
<cite>Numantia</cite>, then would the Spanish drama, perhaps,
under his guidance have taken a different direction,
and reached a higher grade of excellence than it
ever attained. But this was not to be. The
genius of the Spanish language was against the first
effort, and the prevailing taste of the people was
equally against the other. The great merit of
Cervantes is not that he founded or perfected a
national dramatic school. This was reserved for
Lope de Vega, who submitted his genius to the
taste of the people, and for Calderon de la Barca,
who refined and exalted it to the utmost pitch of
which it was capable. But this merit he may certainly
claim, that he was the first to give a certain
form and fulness to what before his time was formless
and void. His <cite>Numantia</cite>, if not a perfect
drama and a model for imitation, has an unwonted
elevation and grandeur. It is free from that turgid
declamation, triviality of incident, and presentation
of horrors for horrors' sake, which were the curse of
the contemporary tragic plays. For simplicity, directness,
and truthfulness of delineation his drama was
unique in its own age, and may, in regard to those
peculiar qualities, prove of some service even in ours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>Those of our readers who desire to pursue the
subject further would do well to consult the higher
dramatic critics. Hallam, in his succinct "History
of the Literature of the Middle Ages," devotes three
pages to the analysis and elucidation of this remarkable
drama, and his judgment both of its excellences
and faults is at once shrewd, candid, and appreciative.
Ticknor, while slightly protesting against the
unmeasured praise bestowed upon it by the Germans,
acknowledges its unique historical value, and
praises especially its lighter portions, condemned by
many as an excrescence, for their exquisite simplicity
and truthfulness. Amongst the Germans, Bouterwek
and Augustus W. Schlegel are especially
enthusiastic in their eulogies. We extract from the
latter's "History of Dramatic Literature" (Black's
translation) the following passage, as just as it is
elegantly expressed: "The <cite>Destruction of Numantia</cite>
has altogether the elevation of the tragical
cothurnus; and, from its unconscious and unlaboured
approximation to antique grandeur and
purity, forms a remarkable phenomenon in the
history of modern poetry.... There is, if I may
so speak, a sort of Spartan pathos in the piece;
every single and personal consideration is swallowed
up in the feeling of patriotism, and by allusions to
the warlike fame of his nation in modern times he
has contrived to connect the ancient history with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
the interests of his own day.... When we consider
the energetical pathos in this drama we are
constrained to consider it as merely accidental that
Cervantes did not devote himself to this species of
writing, and find room in it for the complete development
of his inventive mind."</p>

<p>Sismondi and such acute critics as Schack and
Lemcke corroborate Schlegel's judgment in almost
every respect. Among French writers such authorities
as M. Royer, who has written an admirable
prose translation of the <cite>Numantia</cite>, and M. Emile
Chasles, whose Life of Cervantes is the most
graphic of all biographies, have given very valuable
and laudatory criticism. The list of critics' names
might easily be extended, but enough has already
been given to justify the importance we have
attached to this unique work of Cervantes.</p>

<p>This is not the place to allude to any other of
Cervantes' dramatic works, or to estimate their
value. We hope yet to have an opportunity of
doing so when we present a translation of his
selected Comedies and Interludes for the approval
of English Cervantistas. Meanwhile we prefer that
this translation of his <cite>Numantia</cite> should go forth
alone. It was produced at first in stirring times
when the Spanish power, that had hitherto held
mastery in the world, was showing symptoms of
declining vigour. This English translation comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
forth in equally stirring times, when the power that
supplanted the Spanish domination, and has so long
ruled the seas, is called on to make a mighty effort
to show that she can do so yet, despite of Teuton,
Gaul, or Russ. The enemies of Old England are
busily predicting for her a fate like that which
overwhelmed Carthage or Numantia. We fear no
such fate if England to herself be true. Still the
call to patriotism is never out of place, and perhaps
the British people who have taken Cervantes to their
hearts as the genial, mirth-provoking humourist, may
be disposed to show him like regard in his character
of poet, soldier, and patriot. It is true the scene he
presents, and the heroism he immortalizes are peculiarly
Spanish; but Cervantes, though a Spaniard to
the backbone, had thoughts that interest humanity,
and the patriotic chord which he strikes in this
drama may perchance find an echo even in our
colder northern bosoms.</p>

<p>At all events Cervantes was no dilettante soldier.
If he talks of the horrors and glories of war and siege
he talks of things he knew and had felt. In his early
manhood he was one of those high-spirited youths
(<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Mozos de gran brio</i>), of good birth and breeding,
who crowded the ranks of the Spanish army in
Italy, to do service to their country and gain honour
thereby. He had fought and bled at Lepanto, in
the affair at Navarino, at the storming of Tunis and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
La Goleta. He was simply a private soldier and did
his duty bravely as hundreds of his comrades did.
Strange to say, it was only during his five years'
captivity in Algiers that he was enabled to display
his higher military qualities and especially
his faculty of command. Amongst the 25,000
Spaniards in that den of horrors he at once took the
foremost place. He was the leader in every daring
plan of escape, and only failed at last through treachery.
He was the originator of that desperate
scheme for the seizure of Algiers by the uprising of
the Christians, which was nipped in the bud by the
faint-heartedness of Philip II., who feared to risk
his fleet in such a glorious enterprise. But successful
or not he was idolized by his comrades, and
feared by his enslavers, who nevertheless would not
touch his life, such was the charm his heroic spirit
exercised. But his bearing as a man was more
heroic still than his daring as a soldier. The
written testimony of his comrades, still preserved,
tells us how gentle he was in manners, how brave
in heart; how generous to his needier brethren
even out of his poverty; how tender to the captive
children and how mindful of their welfare; how
proud of his honour as a Spaniard, and steadfast in
his faith as a Christian, while hundreds surrendered
both in the sheer agony of despair. Cervantes escaped,
as by a miracle, from a life-long slavery in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
Constantinople; but only to wage a life-long battle
with adverse fate, and at length to die with a smile
on his lips.</p>

<p>In the Dedication we have ventured to link the
name of Gordon with that of Cervantes, and in so
doing we feel we do no dishonour to the name of
either. Though differing in language and creed,
and separated by well-nigh three centuries, they
are, nevertheless, kindred souls. In both the
Quixotic spirit, in its noblest sense, is clearly displayed.
Cervantes was the inventor of Quixotism
because it lay deep in his nature. This Quixotism,
what is it but the sublime of imprudence? To do
what the enthusiasm of the soul prompts and compels;
to do it with single-hearted unselfishness;
without regard to the adequacy or inadequacy of
means; without regard even to eventual success or
non-success; but with simple regard to the inspired
voice of duty within, come what may: that is Quixotism
in supreme degree. Of this sublime imprudence
Cervantes and Gordon were equally guilty in their
day, and both reaped the reward of it, especially
from their country's rulers. It was their joint fate
during life to be an enigma to most, a wonder to
many, and in death or after death to be beloved by
all. It is not for us to say more of the noble man
whose name is now a household word amongst us.
It is to be hoped when his Diaries are brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
light, and the true story of his sufferings and death
is known, that one of our gifted poets may do for
the Hero of Khartoum what Cervantes has done
for the heroes of Numantia, with a higher harp if
not with loftier patriotism. Meanwhile we may be
permitted to pay, with all humility, this little tribute
to his memory.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we have cordially to thank Don
Pascual de Gayangos for the interest he has shown
in this venture, and for the pains he has taken to
elucidate the errors and imperfections of the original
text. We have also to thank our dear Amanuensis,
whose delicate taste, and skill in languages ancient
and modern, have added materially to any worth
this little work may have.</p>

<p class="drop-capx"><em>Scipio.</em> This general was the famous Publius Scipio
Aemilianus Africanus Minor. His first campaign in
Spain was in the year <span class="fs70">B.C.</span> 151, when he acted as "legatus"
to the Consul Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who was then engaged
in the conquest of the Celtiberians. He greatly distinguished
himself at the siege of Intercacia, where he was
the first to scale the battlements, and received for his exploit
a mural crown. He also displayed his personal courage in
fighting single-handed and slaying a mighty Spanish giant,
who used to insult and defy the whole Roman camp. He
was then about thirty-four years of age. In the year <span class="fs70">B.C.</span> 147
he was elected Consul and sent to Africa, where he fulfilled
the stern mandate of the Senate: "Delenda est Carthago!"
and became the most renowned warrior of his age. In the
year <span class="fs70">B.C.</span> 134, when affairs in Spain were at the lowest ebb,
and the Numantines had thoroughly cowed the Romans,
Scipio was again made Consul, and sent to do what no one
else was thought competent to do&mdash;to bring the siege of
Numantia to a final end. The result is well-known, and
details may be found in the pages of Floras, Appian, Plutarch,
and Livy. A very graphic summary of these is given
in the third book of Mariana's <cite lang="es" xml:lang="es">Historia de España</cite>. The
vivid picture presented in this tragedy of Cervantes may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
suffice, however, for the present generation. Though Scipio
is therein represented simply as the chief minister of Fate,
yet his personality stands boldly out; and his character as
accomplished scholar, stern disciplinarian, and cautious tactician,
is very skilfully pourtrayed. His stirring address to
the soldiers is a perfect epitome of his whole military creed.
The fall of Numantia was the sensation of the day throughout
the empire, and the last great military feat of Scipio. It
settled the fate of Spain for many a long year. Scipio entered
Rome in triumph, and the Senate added to his other
titles that of "Numantinus."</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap"><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2">Note 2</a>, Page 1.</p>

<p><em>Jugurtha.</em> This notorious Numidian prince, the illegitimate
son of Manastabal, grandson of Masanissa, and the
nephew of Mecipsa, king of Numidia, was sent by his uncle
to give succour to Scipio during the siege of Numantia. He
arrived there with a train of ten elephants, and a goodly
array of horse and foot. His uncle's secret design, however,
was to get rid of him, as a dangerous rival to his own sons,
Adherbal and Hiempsal, in the succession to the crown.
This, however, was not to be. Jugurtha not only survived
the campaign, but so distinguished himself, that he became a
prime favourite of Scipio, and returned to his native country
with added lustre to his name, and stores of military experience.
His after-career, adventurous, reckless, and unfortunate,
which led him at last to the Mamertine prisons in
Rome, does not concern us. It is to be found, as every
schoolboy knows, in the brilliant pages of Sallustius, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De
bello Jugurthino</cite>.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap"><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3">Note 3</a>, Page 2.</p>

<p><em>Caius Marius.</em> This man, whom Cervantes represents as
a bluff, quick-witted, daring soldier, was the celebrated Caius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Marius, a plebeian by birth, and the cruel scourge of the
patricians in after times. He was only twenty-three years of
age at the date of the siege, and was still in the ranks. His
peculiar military qualities gained him the good-will of Scipio,
who used often to invite him to his table. On one occasion,
when the question was asked where a similar general to
Scipio could be found when he was gone, Scipio placed his
hand on the shoulder of Marius and said smilingly, "There,
perhaps!" The glory and experience he gained under Scipio's
auspices were the foundation of his future fortunes. Strange
to say, when twenty years afterwards he rode in triumphal
procession through the streets of Rome on account of his
victories in Africa, the principal captive who graced his
triumph was his old Numantian comrade, Jugurtha, in chains.
The prince and the peasant had met again, but under what
altered circumstances!</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap"><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4">Note 4</a>, Page 6.</p>

<p><em>Full sixteen years and more.</em> According to the Latin historians,
the war with Numantia lasted fourteen years, and the
close siege under Scipio, a year and three months. The
ruins of Numantia are still to be seen at Puente de Garray,
near the source of the Duero, about five miles from Soria, an
ancient town of Old Castile. The present remains, however,
are principally imperial, and prove that the town must afterwards
have been rebuilt. Numantia was a stronghold by
nature. It was situated on a little hill precipitous on three
sides, and on the fourth, looking towards the north, sloping
down to a spacious plain, covered with thick forests and
fertile fields, watered by the Tera, a tributary of the Duero.
From its commanding position in the centre of northern
Spain, it served as a bulwark to check the advance of the
Roman legions, and also as a city of refuge for the oppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
tribes. According to Cervantes its warriors amounted only
to three thousand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container-c"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"Can three thousand stand the shock</p>
<p class="verse">Of the eighty thousand there?"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Some historians estimate the number at eight thousand, and
even this seems too small for the grandeur of their achievements.
On one occasion (three years before the advent of
Scipio) when the Consul, Caius Hostilius Mancinus, raised
the siege in despair, and attempted to escape through the
defiles of the mountain by night, the Numantines sallied
forth in force, slaughtered 20,000 of the Roman troops, and
allowed the rest to capitulate, under condition of signing a
perpetual peace with Numantia, and retiring to Rome. The
Roman Senate repudiated the transaction, and sent back the
disgraced Consul to submit to the mercy of the Numantines.
Thereafter it was found necessary to concentrate the whole
military talent of Rome on the reduction of this proud city.
The siege of Numantia, like that of Saguntum, displayed in
a marvellous way the tenacity, vigour, and reckless heroism
of the aboriginal tribes of Spain. It was, therefore, with a
pardonable pride that Cervantes, intent on rousing the patriotic
feeling of his countrymen, addressed them as:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container-c"><div class="poetry" lang="es" xml:lang="es">
<p class="verse">"Los hijos de la fuerte España,</p>

<p class="noindent">This famous river (the <em>Durius</em> of the Romans) we prefer
calling, in Portuguese fashion, the Douro, as being a name
more familiar to English ears, and more amenable, too, to
the laws of rhythm.</p>

<p><em>And, forcing way into the Vatican.</em> The event here alluded
to is the fearful sack of Rome, in 1527, perpetrated by a
portion of the army of Charles V. under the command of the
Constable de Bourbon, when the Pope took refuge, and was
besieged, in the castle of St. Angelo. The "Pilot of the
Sacred Bark" was Clement VII.</p>

<p><em>The great Albano he.</em> This is a poetical name for Fernando
Alvarez de Toledo, the Duke of Alva, who was famous for
many things and infamous for more. The exploit referred to
is the siege of Rome by Alva, after the battle of St. Quentin,
1557, when the French, who were allies of Pope Paul IV.
against the Spaniards, had to leave Italy to save their own
capital and country. In the time of Cervantes, no doubt,
this siege was looked upon with pride as a "brandishing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the Spanish knife above the Roman neck," but in the light
of history we see nothing more than a mock siege, a mock
defence, and a mock withdrawal. Alva's hands were thoroughly
fettered by his devout master, Philip II., who feared
to humiliate the Pope too much, lest he should lose his title
of "Most Catholic Majesty." This event is narrated with
sarcastic brevity by Motley in the third book of his "History
of the Netherlands."</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap"><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8">Note 8</a>, Page 23.</p>

<p><em>The second Philip, second yet to none.</em> No doubt Philip II.,
at this period, had more power in his hand than had ever
been held by a purely Spanish king. Motley, in his characteristic
way, thus sums up his many titles: "He was king of
all the Spanish kingdoms, and of both the Sicilies. He was
titular king of England, France, and Jerusalem. He was
'Absolute Dominator' in Asia, Africa, and America. He
was Duke of Milan, and both the Burgundies, and Hereditary
Sovereign of the Seventeen Netherlands." To all this mighty
inheritance he himself added the crown of Portugal. Cervantes
took a part, maimed as he was, in this conquest, and it is,
therefore, with legitimate pride that he speaks of the "Lusitanian
banner that had been knit anew to the stately robes of
Castile." Sixty years, however, sufficed to tear it asunder
again. What Cervantes thought of Philip as a man and a
ruler we can only conjecture. Twelve years after, in 1598,
when the life of this monster of cruel bigotry had come to an
end, and pompous funeral rites were everywhere being celebrated,
we find Cervantes standing in the cathedral of Seville
gazing on the astounding catafalque raised in honour of the
deceased, and reciting with a roguish air that famous sonnet
of his, beginning, "<em>I vow to God this grandeur stuns my
brain!</em>" This sonnet, which Cervantes prized as the prime
honour of his writings (<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">honra principal de mis escritos</i>), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
which his countrymen regard as a model of exquisite raillery,
was certainly not intended to do honour to the dead. Philip
was no friend of poets, players, or outspoken thinkers, and
literature breathed again when he expired. For a translation
of the sonnet, see Gibson's translation of the "Journey to
Parnassus," p. 375.</p>

<p><em>The Body.</em> Ticknor, who is certainly not over-lavish at
any time in his praise of Cervantes, declares that the incantations
of Marquino surpass in dignity those of the Faustus
of Marlowe, who was a contemporary of Cervantes. He
also affirms, that not even Shakespeare, when he presents on
the stage the armed head raised up, under constraint, to reply
to the criminal enquiries of Macbeth, excites so much our
sympathy and horror as does Cervantes with that tormented
spirit, which returns to life only to suffer a second time the
pangs of dissolution and death. We give here the original of
the speech of the resuscitated corpse, which Bouterwek describes
as terrific:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2 pfs90" lang="es" xml:lang="es">EL CUERPO.</p>

<p class="verse">Engañaste si piensas que recibo</p>
<p class="verse">Contento de volver á esta penosa,</p>
<p class="verse">Misera y corta vida que ahora vivo,</p>
<p class="verse">Que ya me va faltando presurosa;</p>

</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Throughout this scene, the pompous solemnity of the regular
priests and the mock-heroic fury of Marquino are cleverly
contrasted. Cervantes, who from his readings was familiar
with all sorts of wizards and enchanters, makes Marquino a
kind of old-world Merlin, kept, however, under necessary
tragic restraint. The time had not yet come for the humours
of "Don Quixote."</p>

<p><em>Sons of mothers, sad in lot.</em> This spirited speech of one of
the Numantine wives has the true Spartan ring in it, of
which our translation is but a feeble echo. We give the
most effective part of it in the original:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container-c"><div class="poetry" lang="es" xml:lang="es">

<p><em>Cause that these wretched Romans.</em> The <em>morale</em> of the
tragedy as a whole is so perfect, and the character of Theogenes,
as represented, is so noble and chivalrous, that this
savage decree of his seems strange and out of keeping. There
are, it is true, more brutal things presented in "Titus Andronicus,"
but that is hardly a model of tragic dignity and
decorum. The Latin historians tell us that when the crisis
arrived the Numantine citizens ate raw flesh, and drugged
themselves with a liquor called <em>Celia</em>, to madden themselves
for the unnatural slaughter; but, artistically speaking, there
was no necessity to give such things prominence especially
in the mouth of Theogenes.</p>


<p class="p2 center smcap"><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12">Note 12</a>, Page 70.</p>

<p><em>Morandro.</em> Bouterwek says: "The transition into light
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">redondillas</i>, for the purpose of interweaving with the serious
business of the fable the loves of a young Numantine, named
Morandro, and his mistress, is certainly a fault in the composition
of the tragedy. But to this fault we are indebted
for some of the finest scenes in the drama." We agree with
the latter assertion, but not with the former. Neither Nature
nor Art forbids the combination; and if love was to be introduced
at all into such a play, the redondilla measure, on
the Spanish stage at least, was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de rigeur</i>. It seems to us
that the little ray of sunshine let into the surrounding gloom,
and then suddenly extinguished, gives a deeper intensity to
the supervening darkness. These love-scenes, moreover, if
such they may be called, for they are very saddening, lead up
to some of the most tragic scenes of the drama. Ticknor has
rendered the whole scene with much spirit, but not in the
metre, nor with the simplicity, of the original. We give
two short extracts. The first contains the opening stanzas:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p class="pfs90 smcap">Morandro.</p>

<p class="verse">En la muerte alegre vida;</p>
<p class="verse">Deja que miren mis ojos</p>
<p class="verse">Un rato tu hermosura</p>

<p><em>Viriato.</em> It is a touch of genius, on Cervantes' part, to
give this youth, who concentrates at last in his own person
all the heroism of his nation, the name of the illustrious
Lusitanian hero, Viriatus, the William Wallace of his age
and country, who for more than a decade was the terror of
the Romans and the pride of his nation, and who, like the
Scottish hero, was at last done to death by treachery.</p>

Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
